# FOSS Infrastructure

Self hosted foss services hosted by me.

## Goals

- Replace closed source apps with FOSS (Google, Vaultwarden, etc...)
- Full control over data
- Decenteralize infrastructure

## Why?

To support foss and to learn IaC (terraform, ansible etc...). Plus some FOSS
apps are much better than closed source ones.
